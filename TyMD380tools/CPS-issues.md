I had been using the MD390 V1.36 CPS without any problems to read/write to my MD380 ***BUT*** they have changed menu entries for the side buttons so now there is NO Zone Select and only a Zone Toggle available which is what I was unknowingly using expecting the results of Zone Select.

Now using CPS MD380 V1.32 and everything works as it should...although the Zone Toggle is quite a nice feature.
