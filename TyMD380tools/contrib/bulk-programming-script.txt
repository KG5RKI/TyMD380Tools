Hi Travis,
First let me say that you have done a wonderful job with this project. I 
use it all the time and have a group of hams that I update there radios 
regularly. But, I am getting tired of meeting them to do these updates. I 
know that if I build them each a programmer that they are not savvy enough 
to enter the commands in the proper order, etc, etc. So I built an .sh file 
and desktop shortcut that will help them and thought I would share with the 
group.

The .sh file is as follows:

#!/bin/bash
cd md380tools
echo "Connect radio to cable and PC. Power the radio by truning the volume 
knob, while holding the PTT and the button above the PTT. The LED should 
start flashing RED/GREEN."
sleep  5
read -p "press [ENTER] to continue..."
git pull
sleep 3
make flash
echo"


************************************************** TURN RADIO OFF THEN BACK 
ON NOW ************************************************************


"
sleep  5
read -p "press [ENTER] to continue..."
make updatedb flashdb
sleep 10

#end of file





The desktop shortcut is as follows:

[Desktop entry]
Name= MD-380 tool updater
Exec=/home/xxxx/updater.sh
Terminal=true
Type=Application
