Howdy y'all,

This directory contains a poor man's attempt at literate disassembly
of the Tytera MD380 firmware.  I'm still playing around with the
format and the notation style, so please be patient.


Run 'make clean all' to open the complete image in Radare2.

Run 'make clean patch' to open the complete image in R2
applying to patch.img, for quickly testing patched functions.
