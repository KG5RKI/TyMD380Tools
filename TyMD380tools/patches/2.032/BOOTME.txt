Howdy y'all,

These are some rough notes on the format for linking a child
application into the MD380 firmware.  These notes are for MD380
version 2.32, and we'll probably do it differently when patching later
versions.

The child application must:
1) Be linked to begin at 0x0809D000.  (Reset handler at 0x0809D004.)
2) Its RESET handler must set the stack address and relocate the
   interrupt table.
3) If the PTT button is *NOT* held, your application should jump to
   the address held in 0x0800C020.

To install your application through DFU on a jailbroken MD380:
1) 'make clean dfuflash' to install experiment.img.
2) Flash your application on top of it, without an erase.
   stm32-dfu write blink_sideload.bin 0x0809D000

Cheers,
--Travis
