#Patches#

These are patches against the official firmware to enable new
features.  In each directory, you will need to add the official
firmware update, such as "MD-380-D2.32(AD).bin", before applying the
patches.

The output files have a .img extension when unencrypted, and a .bin
extension when packaged for the official firmware updater.
